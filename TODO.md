1. Implement basic function manipulation: copying, algorithm for constructing simplification, partial differentation.
2. Add implicit multiplication.
3. Add assignment operator '=' for passing outputs from function calls to a variable.
4. Implement File IO.
5. Implement graphing.
6. Newton's Method, Value Estimation, Root Finding, Integration
7. Write more scripts to fuzz out bugs.
