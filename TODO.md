# What TODO:

1. Protect file opener from opening non-.ask files.
2. Implement CONST FUNCTION allocation strategy for performance.
3. Implement basic function manipulation: algorithm for constructing the inverse, simplification, partial differentation.
4. Add function composition support.
5. Resolve incompatibility issue when a scalar in inputted to a function.
6. Remove exit command when invalid token is passed to function reader.
7. Add new commands like linspace to make vector allocation easier.
8. BUG: remove ability to define function circularly (f (x) -> f)
9. BUG: add safety check when function is vector-valued so it only accepts the same dimension of vector
10. Add implicit multiplication.
