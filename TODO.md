# What TODO:

1. Rebuild recursive function evaluator system in new framework.
2. Begin merge in to main output executable, begin removal of deprecated files from old framework.
3. Protect file opener from opening non-.ask files.
4. Implement CONST FUNCTION allocation strategy for performance.
5. Fuzz for bugs in full system, gstring appears to be buggy during reallocation.
