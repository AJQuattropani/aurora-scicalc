# What TODO:

1. Simplification Features:
    - Fix no-simplification on case where consteval portions are unable to merge due to a non-const expression separating them in commutative operations.
2. Implement File IO.
3. Implement graphing.
4. Newton's Method, Value Estimation, Root Finding, Integration
5. Write more scripts to fuzz out bugs.
6. Add an automatic '==' reader that does not require explicit naming of type.
7. Add new function representations:
    - LaTex
    - C/C++ function
    - Python function
8. Add testing system.
