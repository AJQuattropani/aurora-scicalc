# What TODO:

1. Implement CONST FUNCTION allocation strategy for performance.
2. Implement basic function manipulation: algorithm for constructing the inverse, simplification, partial differentation.
4. Resolve incompatibility issue when a scalar is inputted to a function.
5. BUG: add safety check when function is vector-valued so it only accepts the same dimension of vector
6. Add implicit multiplication.
7. Add assignment operator '=' for passing outputs from function calls to a variable.
8. Implement deletion.
9. Add function composition support.
