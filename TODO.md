# What TODO:

1. Implement CONST FUNCTION allocation strategy for performance.
2. Implement basic function manipulation: algorithm for constructing the simplification, partial differentation.
3. Add implicit multiplication.
4. Add assignment operator '=' for passing outputs from function calls to a variable.
5. Add function composition support.
6. Implement File IO.
7. Implement graphs.
8. Newton's Method, Root Finding, Integration
