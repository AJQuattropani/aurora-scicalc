# What TODO:

1. Implement CONST FUNCTION allocation strategy for performance.
2. Implement basic function manipulation: copying, algorithm for constructing simplification, partial differentation.
3. Add implicit multiplication.
4. Add assignment operator '=' for passing outputs from function calls to a variable.
5. Implement File IO.
6. Implement graphing.
7. Newton's Method, Value Estimation, Root Finding, Integration
8. Make certain tokens, e.g. operators, also behave as delimiters. May make autonomous, or may simply implement for basic operators.
