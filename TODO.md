# What TODO:

1. Protect file opener from opening non-.ask files.
2. Implement CONST FUNCTION allocation strategy for performance.
3. Implement basic function manipulation: algorithm for constructing the inverse, partial differentation.
4. Add function composition support.
5. Add support for special scalars in vectors.
6. Resolve incompatibility issue when a scalar in inputted to a function.
7. Make ',' a valid delimiter for parsing tokens.
8. Remove exit command when invalid token is passed to function reader.
9. Add new commands like linspace to make vector allocation easier.
